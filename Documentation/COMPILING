How to compile QweakSimG4:
=========================

  - First, install Geant4 =8-)
  - Make sure all your G4* environment variables are set.
  - cd in the QweakSimG4 directory (e.g. cd ~/Project/Qweak/Geant4/v60)
    
       export G4WORKDIR=`pwd`

  - the comilation is done with  
               
       make clean
       make


How to run QweakSimG4:
=====================

  => In case of the very first compilation: make a symbolic link to the binary
  
      ln -s bin/Linux-g++/QweakSimG4 QweakSimG4
    
   then make symbolic links to the field maps
  
      ln -s ../MagnetFieldMaps/MainMagnet_FieldMap.dat MainMagnet_FieldMap.dat
      ln -s ../MagnetFieldMaps/MiniTorus_FieldMap.dat  MiniTorus_FieldMap.dat
  
   and a symbolic link to the primary event file (depending which collimator or ntuple is final now ...)
   
      ln -s  ../PrimaryEvents/ROOT/v5.08/ep_m84_qweak_final.root ep_elastic.root
      

   Finally the simulation is started by
   

     ./QweakSimG4 > mylogfile.txt                  For visualization with new events with Coin3D
     
     ./QweakSimG4 myRun.mac > /dev/zero            For running with several k events without visualization
     

About using the visualization:

Executing  the command "./QweakSimG4 > mylogfile.txt" will open a G4UIXm window for steering the simulation.
Within this window click on: Vis->myVis.mac (OIX). This will execute the Geant4 input file ./myVis.mac which
will open a Coin3D window for geometry/track visualization. The Coin3D is black/blank initially. Click in the 
Coin3D window on "Etc->visible mother + visible daughters" , this will then display the geometry. 
Click Help->Controls for how to use the mouse pointer or the wheels for rotating, zooming, or moving the geometry.
Back in the G4UIXm you can change parameters of the simulation:
 - e.g. click on "DetectorHut->ShowTopWall" , then click in Coin3D on "Etc->visible mother + visible daughters"
 - e.g. click on "TrackingAction->Track primaries only", this will track/transport only the primary electrons 
defined by the event generator (root-file), secondaries are produced but not tracked.
 
After you have selected your options, click finally on "Run->beamOn X" for starting the simulation. In Coin3D the screen
gets erased, so do again "Etc->visible mother + visible daughters" for displaying geometry and tracks.
In addition you might erase tracks and/or geometry in Coin3D using  "Etc->Erase event" or "Etc->Erase detector"
Beware that selecting more than 100 tracks will significantly slow down the visualization, depending on the speed of 
your machine.


How to analyse QweakSimG4:
==========================

QweakSim produces a Root file with the name "QweakSim.root". You can use the TBrowser of root in order to browse through
the root file and understand it's data structure. For analysing the root file like filling some histograms of interest,
take a closer look into the root macro "ShowHits.C" (beware: prototype!) and see how the information is extracted.
